I am a final year PhD candidate in the Mathematics Department of the University College London under the supervision of Prof Hao Ni. My research interests lie at the intersection of Rough path theory, machine learning and financial mathematics, particularly for their applications on time series prediction and synthetic data generation. I also actively collaborate with researchers in the [Datasig research group](https://datasig.ac.uk/) and [Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/) to design software for real-life problems, including molecular learning, sepsis and covid-19 predictions.  

When I am not working or studying, I can usually be found playing badminton, doing bouldering and travelling.
