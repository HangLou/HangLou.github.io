I am a final year PhD candidate the Mathematics Department of the University College London under the supervison by Prof Hao Ni. My research interests lie at the intersection of Rough path theory, machine learning and geometric deep learning, in particular for their applications on time series prediction and synthesis data generation. 

When I'm not working studying, I can usually found playing badminton, doing bouldering and travelling.
